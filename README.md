# Elo-Matchmaking-Demo
Elo-Based matchmaking demo for ComS 437 presentation

This demo is an example of the differences between a ramdom matchmaking queue, win-based matchmaking queue and Elo-based matchmaking queue.

The way this works is by simulating a games ranking system. The number of players, games and skill can be changed. 

## The game
The game is simple. Each player must guess a number from a range of numbers. The higher the skill of the player, the less numbers in the pool they will guess from.
For example, a player with twice the skill will have half the range of numbers to guess.

## The players
Each player has a skill rating. The higher the skill, the easier the game is for them. The players are evenly distributed over a spectrum of skill ratings.
